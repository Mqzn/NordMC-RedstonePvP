# NordMC-RedStonePvP
Pure trash plugin that A fraud named "Fares" made for his trash server called "NordMC"
He basically had a `while(true)` in Combat class which made NordMC very laggy (200% CPU) , so i removed all of his combat classes
and made 2 classes to manage combat.

Other than these 4 classes (`CombatData`, `CombatManager`,`FastBoard` and `FastBoard Reflection`), everything was written by him
I leaked this, as an example of the worst case redstone pvp plugin as it contains

- Static abuse
- Bad methods and variables names (not following java naming conventions)
- Poor Style and OOP
- No Design

**This is the fraud's discord:** Fares#8770 
Don't ever let him deceive you, this guy basically lies for living.
and doesn't know anything about java or coding in general
